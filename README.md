### precision is art. chaos is data. everything else is noise.

**quantitative analyst building systems that read markets before people do.**  
fusing behavioral patterns, market microstructure, and AI-driven analytics.  
no signals, no hype - just structure, tension, and math that breathes.

## **core systems**

building infrastructure that doesn't wait for confirmation candles.

### **[rocket-rs](https://github.com/lubluniky/rocket-rs)** → reinforcement learning library for rust
high-performance RL with PPO and A2C algorithms. performance-critical training loops meet type safety.

**stack:** rust · reinforcement learning · optimization

---

### **[siphon_x](https://github.com/lubluniky/siphon_x)** → self-healing API harvester & TUI
headless browser automation extracting undocumented endpoints. reverse-engineering for profit.

**stack:** rust · headless browsing · API discovery

---

### **[backtesting-kernel](https://github.com/lubluniky/backtesting-kernel)** → high-performance backtesting engine
c kernel + rust FFI + python API. **626M+ ticks/sec**. built for speed, not convenience.

**stack:** c · rust · python · low-latency systems

---

### **[polymarket-botkit](https://github.com/lubluniky/polymarket-botkit)** → production-ready polymarket infrastructure
execution gateway + risk management monorepo. prediction markets meet real execution.

**stack:** rust · trading infrastructure · risk management

---

### **[quant-mind-mcp](https://github.com/lubluniky/quant-mind-mcp)** → MCP server for quantitative analysis
AI-powered financial modeling and research. multi-agent orchestration for quant workflows.

**stack:** python · AI agents · financial modeling

---

## **focus areas**

- **crypto · fx · stocks** → multi-asset quantitative strategies
- **stack:** rust · c · go · python · cuda · j · typescript · docker · kubernetes
- **obsession:** data · math · monster energy

---

## **research vectors**

currently exploring:
- quantitative finance (q-fi) → market microstructure, order flow dynamics
- data science → high-dimensional time series, feature engineering
- computer science → low-latency systems, distributed computing
- reinforcement learning → agent-based trading systems

---

## **philosophy**

markets don't reward prediction. they reward preparation.

building systems that operate in the space between structure and chaos - where mathematical rigor meets behavioral noise. every position is a hypothesis. every backtest is a conversation with reality. every line of code is an opinion about how information moves through systems.

no heroics. no narratives. just rigorous engineering applied to probabilistic outcomes.

---

## **connect**

open for collaboration on high-performance systems, quantitative research, and algorithmic trading infrastructure.
